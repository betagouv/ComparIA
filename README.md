Le comparateur est bas√© sur [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) et [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/), le code de l'ar√®ne Chatbot Arena par LMSYS (voir [Project architecture and rationale (en)](https://github.com/betagouv/ComparIA?tab=readme-ov-file#project-architecture-and-rationale) plus bas).

The comparator is based on [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) and [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/), the Chatbot Arena code by LMSYS (see [Project architecture and rationale](https://github.com/betagouv/ComparIA?tab=readme-ov-file#project-architecture-and-rationale) below).



## Run the arena

1. Rename `register-api-endpoint-file.json.dist` to `register-api-endpoint-file.json` and add valid API keys

### With Docker

`cd docker/; docker compose up -d`

### Without Docker

Due to how Gradio's Custom Components work and because they haven't been published as Python packages, building them manually is a bit tedious. At the moment we use 4 custom components: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd custom_components/frinput
gradio cc install;gradio cc build --no-generate-docs
cd ../../custom_components/customradiocard
gradio cc install;gradio cc build --no-generate-docs
cd ../../custom_components/customdropdown
gradio cc install;gradio cc build --no-generate-docs
cd ../../custom_components/customchatbot
gradio cc install; npm install @gouvfr/dsfr;gradio cc build --no-generate-docs
cd ../..
```
then `export LANGUIA_DEBUG=True; uvicorn main:app --reload --timeout-graceful-shutdown 1` or simpy `uvicorn main:app`

## Project architecture and rationale

### LMSys fork
We initially forked LMSYS' FastChat codebase, used at https://lmarena.ai to get an immediately running arena. Its architecture was composed of:
- the arena (a Gradio project with 2-3 Python files)
- a controller to register model workers

But as it was easier to run models in vLLM Docker containers or by using external APIs, the controller / model workers architecture ended up being unused code. Furthermore, we needed a dashboard for the controller so it got recoded.

### Custom Components
Our main focus with compar:IA is to invest heavily on overall design and UX/UI. Thanks to Gradio's [Custom Components](https://www.gradio.app/guides/custom-components-in-five-minutes) we can customize any Gradio component as a Svelte app, and control the user interface look and feel.

We currently use 4 distinct (and poorly named) Custom Components:
- `FrInput`: the [DSFR](https://www.systeme-de-design.gouv.fr/) input component
- `CustomDropdown`: encompasses most of the first screen, with mode selection, models selection, and initial textarea
- `CustomRadioCard`: used in the first screen for suggestions and later for voting
- `CustomChatbot`: a component crafted for the specific compar:IA experience, allowing you to compare two chatbots' response to one user message, and receive user's feedback

### Mounted `gradio.Blocks` within a FastAPI app

Because we needed a static website as well, we used Gradio's [`mount_gradio_app`](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/mount_gradio_app`) feature, allowing you to customize how FastAPI serves the gradio app (Gradio is based on FastAPI), while using the underlying FastAPI app to serve other pages. This lives in `main.py` while the main Gradio code is in `languia/block_arena.py`.
The static site's pages are in the `templates/` folder, which also hosts the complex Jinja2 template files needed in the arena (especially after the "reveal" step).

### Future evolutions

After 8 months of intensive development, the Gradio framework may show some limits, especially when it comes to fully custom CSS. Ugly CSS overrides are used heavily throughout this repo (especially in the infamous `assets/custom-arena.css`), while the integration of the French design system (DSFR) is made difficult by how Gradio adds a lot of Svelte-generated CSS everywhere.
Furthermore, since the app is now more stable, we don't need to iterate quickly anymore, which is what Gradio allowed, and we could gain some snappiness by using a Svelte SPA (Single Page App) and a lighter frontend-backend communication.
I feel there is a gradual path consisting in decapsulating the Custom Components one by one into a basic Svelte app, and replace Gradio with a basic FastAPI endpoint, screen-by-screen and iterating. If you have opinions on this, I warmy welcome you to open an issue on the matter üôÉ
